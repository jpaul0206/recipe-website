I have developed a recipe application using the ReactJS framework and integrated it with an API. 
The application leverages React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM rendering to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
The API integration allows the application to fetch recipe data from external sources, enabling users to access a wide range of recipes and related information.
This integration also allows for the retrieval of additional details such as ingredients, nutritional information, and user reviews, enhancing the richness of the recipe content.
